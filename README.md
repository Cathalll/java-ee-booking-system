# java-ee-booking-system
Java EE web application (MVC, JDBC, MySQL): A booking system with seperate user roles (Admin, Teacher, Student) using a common login. Featuring a shopping cart functionality and other CRUD operations.     Changed laptop; migrated from Netbeans 8.2 to Netbeans 13  Migrated from JDK 8 to JDK 17  Had some difficulty getting the site to work with the newer MySQL Driver from Netbeans, so this commit includes the old MySQL driver from Netbeans 8.2. This driver is included in the new 'external-libs' folder to prevent this type of issue recurring
